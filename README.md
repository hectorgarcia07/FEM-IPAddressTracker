### Built with

### What I learned

This is my first solution for the FrontEndMentor challenge! Decided to exercise my JS
skills and compleated this challange using pure vanilla JS.

I managed to learn a few new things related to CSS such as positioning, animation, and
accessibility design. I also managed to incorporate JS ES6 syntax.
